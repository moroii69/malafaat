# Security Policy for Archivos

## 1. Introduction
This security policy outlines the measures taken to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Archivos project. It provides guidelines to ensure that security is considered at every stage of development and use.

## 2. Objectives
- Protect sensitive user data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Ensure secure software development practices.
- Respond to security incidents promptly and effectively.
- Promote awareness and training regarding security best practices among team members.

## 3. Data Protection
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit (using TLS) and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive information.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only the data that is necessary for the functionality of the application.

## 4. Secure Development Practices
- **Code Review**: Implement regular code reviews to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: Keep all third-party libraries and dependencies updated to their latest stable versions.
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
  
## 5. Authentication and Authorization

- **Response Plan**: Maintain an incident response plan that includes identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

## 7. Security Training
- Provide regular training for all team members on security best practices and emerging threats.
- Encourage a culture of security awareness within the team.

## 8. Compliance
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding data protection and privacy.

## 9. Review and Updates
